# Zulrah Overlay Helper

Microbot's Zulrah Helper augments the fight by tracking rotations, warning about attacks, and highlighting optimal defensive prayers.

## Features
- Displays upcoming phases, total ticks, and a rotation timer so you know when to move.
- Overlays the correct prayer and attack style with optional phase flipping for mirror rotations.
- Highlights toxic clouds, projectiles, and snakeling spawns to keep the arena safe.
- Provides MES hotkey handling when using Snakeling MES settings for better minion aggro control.

## Usage
1. Enable the Zulrah Helper plugin inside Microbot.
2. Configure prayer helper, phase overlays, and snakeling settings to match your gear and preferences.
3. Enter a Zulrah instance; the overlays automatically activate once the boss spawns.
4. Follow the rotation guidance and prayer prompts.
